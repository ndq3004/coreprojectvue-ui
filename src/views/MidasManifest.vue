                  Who I am is not really as important, as what I’m about to
                  share with you, but you can call me Vincent. I’ll get more
                  into who I am a bit later, but if you stick around for the
                  next few minutes, I’m going to teach you the strange, but
                  incredibly powerful wealth generating Midas Manifestation

                  of the population use to alter their previously predetermined
                  destiny… <br /><br />I’ll reveal how you can secretly tap into
                  the universe, to create unlimited wealth, health and abundance
                  in your life. You’ll be able to do this at will, and generate

                  Then, it dawned on me… could it be… that this book was a lost
                  manuscript from the lost library of Alexandria? Some of the
                  markings resembled markings manuscripts from that library had,
                  but I couldn’t be sure unless I had time to study them and
                  compare them. <br /><br />The library of Alexandria, was an
                  ancient library that was said to contain vast amounts of
                  knowledge and long forgotten secrets, and was destroyed in
                  what many historians believe (including myself) to be a fire,
                  along with many rare books from all around the world.
                  <br /><br />I knew I had to have this book, so I took it up to
                  the front of the store, and asked the shop owner “How much?”
                  He looked at me and smiled, and said in a quiet voice in his
                  local dialect, he knew that book would find the right person
                  one day.

                  We agreed on a price, and I walked out of there with the book.
                  That is the day my life changed forever.
                  <br /><br />I told my friend I was tired, and wanted to return
                  back to our hotel, but really, my mind was racing with what I
                  had just purchased and I couldn’t wait to examine it more.
                  <br /><br />The book, while pretty badly damaged, was full of
                  mystical incantations, diagrams, and what looked like to be
                  sets of instructions… although at the time I couldn’t decipher
                  it easily.

                I stayed up nearly all night trying to translate what I could
                without my notes and resources of my home office to help. The
                text that I deciphered, talked about vibrational energy of the
                soul. It explained that every living human, has a unique
                vibrational energy. The consciousness, was the gateway to the
                universe, and allowed the universe to directly interact with
                your vibrational energy.
                <br /><br />It seemed to suggest, that these Egyptian Gods, were
                the ones giving this knowledge to the people. Once I returned
                home from Egypt, I was able to fully investigate the manuscript.

                  Now, I know you’re wondering what this has to do with
                  manifesting abundance, money and wealth, I promise, I’m about
                  to reveal the secret I learned, and I know you’re going to
                  absolutely love it.

                  <br /><br />It was then that I discovered something very
                  strange… references to something known as the Akashic records.

              <div class="mt-3">
                I’ve always thought this was a myth, however renowned psychics
                like Edgar Cayce have talked about it in detail, and claimed to
                channel information from it.
                <br /><br />The Akashic records are mentioned here and there in
                some ancient manuscripts. It’s believed that everything that has
                ever been, and will be, is encoded directly into the fabric of
                the universe, and that by tapping into this phenomenon; you can
                essentially access information directly from the universe.
                <br /><br />While in some sort of trance, Edgar Cayce was
                miraculously able to diagnose people with medical conditions,
                even though he had no medical training and have never met the
                people he was diagnosing. While asked questions about a variety
                of topics, he would give detailed, knowledgeable answers.

                  As I decoded more of this manuscript, I uncovered detailed
                  instructions about how to access the Akashic records, as well
                  as other information related to the 12 sacred chakras (yes,
                  there are 12, not 7) and knowledge related to the power of
                  sound, consciousness and the body. I was utterly fascinated by
                  what I was discovering. Part of me wanted to dismiss it as
                  “mythology” or “fiction” but in my gut, I knew it was
                  something much more than that.

                    I decided to practice the methods described in this
                    manuscript to access that Akashic records. My main goal was
                    to try to figure out if it there was really something to it,
                    and if so, to try to gain insight directly from the Akashic
                    records related to the diagrams, instructions and texts I
                    was trying to decipher from the manuscript I had recovered.
